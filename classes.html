<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Founded in 2018, MeiShi Art Center, located south of Portland, teaches art and digital design classes to people of
    all ages and all levels. Today, our innovative program reaches students across the United States and Canada.</p>

<h1>Our Educational Philosophy</h1>
<p>
    MeiShi Art Center has developed a unique art curriculum emphasizing the creative and imaginative process. Every day,
    we encourage students to forge their own creative paths, aiming to create works with broader perspectives and
    immersive artistic experiences. This includes inspiring student works that advocate for environmental and social
    justice, as many award-winning works embody a sense of responsibility and commitment to world peace and justice. We
    are passionate arts educators, and we care deeply about helping every student realize their dreams through art. We
    strive to improve students' abilities in artistic appreciation, expression, and creation, while instilling
    perseverance through difficulties.

Through the experiential approach of MeiShi Art Center, you'll build hands-on experience that combines traditional fine arts with today's digital tools and techniques.
