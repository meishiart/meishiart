                                <p>Mei Shi's parents are intellectuals in the scientific research area, and his father likes painting and calligraphy. His neighbors, uncles and aunts, all majored in science and engineering, and they had completely different views on Mei Shi's persistent preference for painting and literature since childhood. Therefore, when Mei Shi was growing up, he often kept his painting in a sneaky state. Eventually going into secondary school, his passion for art became irreversible and his parents began to strongly support this path.</p>
