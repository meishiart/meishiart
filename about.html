                                    <p>Mei Shi's parents are intellectuals in the scientific research area, and his
                                        father likes painting and calligraphy. His neighbors, uncles and aunts, all
                                        majored in science and engineering, and they had completely different views on
                                        Mei Shi's persistent preference for painting and literature since childhood.
                                        Therefore, when Mei Shi was growing up, he often kept his painting in a sneaky
                                        state.
                                    <p>Eventually going into secondary school, his passion for art became irreversible
                                        and his parents began to strongly support this path.</p>
                                    <p>Throughout his childhood and lasting into life beyond, Mei Shi has found a
                                        consistent source of inspiration in the works of Eugene Delacroix and Vincent
                                        Van Gogh.</p>

                <p>Through pivotal moments during his college experience, both personally and politically, Mei Shi
                    developed a sense of deep gratitude for the people and opportunities around him. Despite working
                    through challenging and unstable times during the Cultural Revolution and navigating the complex and
                    at times unforgiving world of business and design, Mei Shi maintained an optimistic and open outlook
                    on life and art.</p>
                <p>After his rigorous undergraduate training in realism and the forms of the human body, Mei Shi
                    was drawn to the wonder and openness of natural landscapes, incorporating mountain vistas,
                    green hills, and the freedom of the outdoors into many of his works.</p>
                <p>Combining the human aspects of gratitude with the awe-inducing nature of natural landscapes, Mei Shi
                    has explored subjects across many art styles: shifting between realistic portraits, landscape
                    studies, interactive experimental works, and abstract pieces.</p>
                <p>However, the one thing that remains constant across his range of artistic endeavors is the continuous
                    path of striving towards free flowing expressions of beauty in all forms.</p>
                <p>"He likes to travel, and he likes to be free and unfettered, even if he just takes a deep breath in
                    front of the sea and listens to the waves; he likes to drive fast, but he doesn't speed. He loves
                    speed without obstacles. There is a natural joyous mentality in his stock. And the heart. Ding also
                    has a world of bliss that belongs to him." - So Hu 2018</p>
